Not all databases are relational. MongoDB is a JSON document store, Redis is an in-memory key-value store, Neo4j is a graph database, and DynamoDb is a popular persistent key-value store available in AWS

Relational databases are commonly referred to as "SQL databases" because you usually do work with them using some variation of the SQL language.

A quality of many relational databases is that they support good guarantees about data integrity. Relational databases can store and modify data in a way that makes data corruption as unlikely as possible.
