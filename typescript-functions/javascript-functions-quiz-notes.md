## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  a function is reusable block of code
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  it has a function declaration keyword and parameters (if any), a code block of what you would like the function to perform, and a return value (if we want to return something)
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  the variable you stored the function in plus parenthesis and the argument being called into the parenthesis
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  a function call is calling back the function which we want to be used later on in our code, while a function definition creates the code we want to be able to use again.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  a parameter is a placeholder and is used in our function definition and gives us an idea of what we can pass into our function later on when we want to call it. while an argument is the data of what we want to pass into our function to have it perform the action the function does
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  parameters are useful because they give us an idea of what to pass in as our arguments. they serve as a placeholder until we call the function
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  a return statement does two things 1. it closes the function and 2. returns a value
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  const variable = (parameter(s): type,...): returnType => expression;
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  when an arrow function is not surrounded in curly braces, it just just performing an expression.
  whereas when an arrow function is surround in curly braces, it is accepting statements before the
  function closes the curly braces.
