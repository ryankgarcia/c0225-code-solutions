## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  destructuring allows the ability to unpack properties from objects into individual variables which simplifies accessing multiple variables.
- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  const {Object.property: variableName1, Object.property: variableName2} = objectName
- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  const [x, y, z] = variableName
- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  by looking to see where the brackets are relative to the = sign.
  if the Object / Array brackets are to the right of the = sign, it is being created.
  On the other hand, if the brackets are to the left of the equals sign, it is being destructured.
