## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the `async` and `await` keywords used for?
  async and await indicate that the JS runtime should 'wait' or 'pause' until the asynchronous function completes. it also improves readability
- How do `async` and `await` differ from `Promise.then` and `Promise.catch`?
  they differ because with promise.then and promise.catch callback functions are used whereas async and await don't require that and instead allow the code to be more readable since the asynchronous functions are assigned to variables and contain the await keyword
- When do you use `async`?
  when we want to perform asynchronous operations and when we want to use the await keyword
- When do you use `await`? When do you _not_ use `await`? (What happens if you `await` a synchronous function?)
  use await when doing asynchronous work. you don't use it when you need code to execute right away. the code would execute right away
- How do you handle errors with `await`?
  errors are handled with try/catch
- What do `try`, `catch` and `throw` do? When do you use them?
  try will try to run all the code in each line of our code block, catch will catch thrown exceptions. they are useful when using async-await. throw is used to throw exceptions
- What happens if you forget to use `await` on a Promise? In that case, what happens to the Promise rejection?
  it becomes a pending promise and we won't know if our promise got rejected, because we never waited for it using the await keyword
- Which style of asynchronous programming do you prefer â€” callbacks, `Promise.then`, or `async/await`? Why?
  async/await. for readability and easier in code writing
