## Notes

- Data structures and algorithms are used to organize and manage large amounts of data.

- The efficiency of a data structure or algorithm is referred to as 'complexity'. There are two types of complexity to consider

1. time complexity and 2. space complexity

- Time complexity refers to how the computation time increases as the number of data items increases
- Space complexity refers to how memory usage increases as the number of data items increases

- Determining the efficiency of a DS and algorithm is referred to as 'Complexity Analysis'
- Complexity analysis involves analyzing the number of operations and amount of memory it takes to perform an operation on N items and then seeing what happens when that number increases
